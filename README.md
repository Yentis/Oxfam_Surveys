# Oxfam_Surveys
Using a KoboCollect app food data is collected and uploaded when the device has a chance to go online.
This food data is linked to a database of foods managed by http://www.nutval.net/.

The food data is then sent to a form you can create with this application.
The application can then let you select a form and open it with nutval.

Nutval will have the food data preloaded into it and ready to analyze.
